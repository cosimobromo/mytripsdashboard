# MyTripsDashboard - Your Trips with no effort
MyTripsDashboard is a Streamlit application  that allows you to easily review you car trip, by analying your _driving conditions_, _itinerary_ and _plot_ the recorded data. Data must be recorded connecting a WiFi/Bluetooth _OBDII_ Interface to your Smartphone using [Torque Pro application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&pcampaignid=web_share).

## Introduction

I first bought my OBDII sensor to record available and precious data during my trips, but I experienced lot of effort in cleaning, casting and visualizing. 
MyTripsDashboard creation was driven by the need to provide me (and others) a rapid tool where by just dragging and dropping the application _.zip_ or _.csv_ file, many reports are created by automatically processing your dataset. 

## Features

- **Sample Dataset Usage:** You don't have a dataset to use but you want to play with the tool? Use a sample dataset I provided.
- **Summary:** Select rapidly what you are interested in, custom metrics and plots will be shown!
- **Map Visualization:** Inspectable map with itinerary and corollary information (e.g., consumption, speed). GPS must be active during recording. 
- **Engine Usage Analysis:** Analyze and plot your engine usage, based on extrapolated gear ratios.
- **Plots:** Create custom 2D plots with label differentiation.
- **Contact Form:** Insert your message to send me a feedback!
